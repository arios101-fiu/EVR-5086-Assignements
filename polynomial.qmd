# Plot the polynomial between x = -1 and x = 1

Observations and the limitations of the numerical derivative. One method is an instantaneous change (associated with he tangent line. The other is an average rate of change between two points.

```{r}

# Define variables
a <- 1
n <- 1
b <- 1
p <- 2
c <- 1
q <- 3

# Create x vectors from -1 to 1
x <- seq(from = -1, to = 1, by = 0.1)

# Calculate the value of y for each value of x
y <- (a * (x^n)) + (b * (x^p)) + (c * (x^q))

# Calculate the analytical derivatives for each value of x
dy_dx <- (a * n * (x^(n - 1))) + (b * p * (x^(p - 1))) + (c * q * (x^(q-1)))

# Calculate the numerical derivatives
deltay <- diff(y)
deltax <- diff(x)
deltay_deltax <- deltay / deltax

# For plotting purposes, derive the midpoint
deltax_vec <- x[-length(x)] + deltax/2

# Build dataframe for plot

# Plot the analytically derivative as a solid line and the numerical derivative as open symbols
